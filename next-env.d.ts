// A file named next-env.d.ts will be created in the root of your project. 
// This file ensures Next.js types are picked up by the TypeScript compiler. 
// You cannot remove it, however, you can edit it (but you don't need to).

// TypeScript strict mode is turned off by default. 
// When you feel comfortable with TypeScript, 
// it's recommended to turn it on in your tsconfig.json.
